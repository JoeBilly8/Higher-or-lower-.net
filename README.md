# Higher or lower
A card game engine built in C# and .NET9 for the popular (often drinking) game "Higher or lower". Built to keep my .NET skills sharp, as well as my 'high level' design and thinking ideas. 

Could be fun to build upon this. Start simple, then add a UI (framework practice?), extra rules and players etc.
